# Project management plan


## The people
Team members strengths and weaknesses.
Skills required, training needed.

### Ness
Training needed on rapid prototyping skills such as OpenSCAD and 3D printing.


## The resources needed
Costing, parts required.


## The timeline



## The assessment of the risks and safety

| Potential Hazard | Risk Level | Hazard Control Strategies |
| -------------    | ---------- | ---------------------   |
| Excessive exposure to VOCs and <br> ultrafine particles from 3D printer| Medium | Proper ventilation <br> Check material is safe to use <br> Turn off printer if jammed|
| Burns from hot surfaces on printer | Medium | Wear protective gloves <br> Don't touch extruder or molten plastic <br> Check bed temperature before handling printed item|
|Getting trapped by moving parts <br> in 3D printer | Low | Keep clear of all moving parts|



## Contengency plans
What could go wrong? What to do when it happens?

### Electronics

### Mechanical

#### Failure to design "snap-fit" module and door:
The snap fit mechanism needs to be decided on rather early in the design process to ensure compatibility between different parts. If such a mechanism could not be reliably prototyped or functional, it would cause difficulties in continuing with other aspects of the project.

#### Difficulties integrating electronics with casing design:
As the casing design is dependent on the type and number of components used by the electronics team, later changes to the design of electronics may affect the design of the casing. If it takes a long time to settle on a design for the electronics module, there may not be enough time to complete the casing design.

#### No time for improving robustness of spring mechanism: 
It is foreseeable that we may run out of time to deeply investigate the self-closing door mechanism, as it involves improving on many iterations of previous designs that may have explored most aspects of torsional springs, and may require extensive testing to yield new results.
