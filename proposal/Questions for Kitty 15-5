Should we make the github private? are you looking to patent the design?

What do you want us to achieve on top of what was previously achieved last year. (Might want to reconcile what exactly was done last year, we have the documentation; was anything (even minor) done on top of that?)
Might want to get her to explain properly and then ask questions on top of that.
- Location tracking? GPS chip?
- Data logging analysis? Save to MicroSD card? or some other cheap storage.
- Integrating on one chip? What exactly does she mean? Two sensors only?
- Ask about electronics - does she have them and how best should we build on that
- Can improve on door design, doesn't feel like there's enough finger clearance, especially if wearing gloves will be difficult to open
- Need to test electronics properly
- Look into a soft-closing door?

- How can we quickly reach Kitty if we need to?
- How frequently shall we meet / call?
