# Problem description

- Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem.

## The problem
Current vaccine carriers use cooler boxes which are poorly adapted to the conditions that they are expected to tackle. They often have very poor cooling lifetimes that can mean the vaccine spoils before it reaches it's destination. In field conditions, lasting about 4 hours which is simply not enough as journeys can often last up to 2 days in 25(?)+ C heat. SMILE, by Ideabatic aims to combat this issue with a unique designed cooler box with a single ice pack that can last up to 4 days (120 hours). 
Can talk about requiring 4 ice packs, but only 1 is used?
