## Electronics/Software:

- Primary target is accuracy/functionality and ease of use!:

  
  Initial display only shows OK or NOT OK; maybe time remaining. Press button for exact temperature, further features like GPS

  
- Implement a sensor for when the door is open or closed; and an indicator to alert if door left open (beeping)


- Make a start on making temperature predictor compatible with door opening; informed by existing data


- Charging mechanism needs to be compatible with modular nature of electronics module: sensor is fixed in door but won't be removed, 
  the rest of the module is removed for charging (clip on, clip off)

  
- Probably using rechargable batteries

  
- Need electronics module to be as thin as possible 



## Mechanical:

- Design of electronics module housing, needs to be modular (an optional add-on to the overall device)


- Design of door for integration with electronics casing


- Design for installment of modular circuitry (with temperature sensor)

  
- Self-closing door mechanism; improved ergonomics
