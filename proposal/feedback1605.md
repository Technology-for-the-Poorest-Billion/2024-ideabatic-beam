- Contextualising the project, embracing last years work and being explicit about improvements we intend ot make
- Skills we came to the project with and what we want to learn from the project (put it in final project too)
- Add images to make it more user furiendly
- There was a bit of jumping around - see below.
- A lot of what was in the contingencies should have been put in the actual proposal, where the contingencies should focus on what to do if those cases occurred.
- Surveys -- use "human-centred design", or similar.
- Back up claims with references for final report. Might be worth asking Kitty where she got the data in her slideshow.
- Be more explicit of primary and secondary objectives
- Make sure that if a group were to continue our work,  it is documented clearly and concisely whilst being easy to understand.
