Stage 1:
- Candidates and designs for electronics module arrangement
- Feasability assessments and rankings, clearly communicating design decisions

- focus on improving environmental resistance aspect of the single-module design

Stage 2:
- Candidates and designs for door mechanism (external button waterproof considerations)
- Feasability assessments and rankings, clearly communicating design decisions
- temp sensor inside compartment (innacurate temp) vs outside compartment (waterproof issue)
- upper limit heat corrpution effects: heat power = electronic power for batteries and display
- compartment should be waterproof but really high heat conductivity if we want to put temperature sensor inside
- eliminate all alternative designs
- make the compartment out of three things: cheap, clear, conductive. 
- material selection (conductivity, heat resistance, cost)
- graphene may not be a mature material in 3D printing technology
- manufacturing complexity
- rough sketch of preferred design

- module is external-clipping onto door so that there is no gap in door when it is not needed. 

- compare with possibility of taking entire door off; customer-wise, why would this be preferable?


Clipping mechanism:
- 3D print from CAD a clip (eg ridge-fitting)
- magnet?


Romeo
- Choosing battery + power consumption theory
- Testing, then Electronics order: battery, physical clips mechanism? (or will this be 3D-printed into door and module?), buzzer? 
- Getting it working with Code 
- Assembling the electronic circuit for both sensor/display + button switch/beeping
- Build see-through compartment on 3D-printed prototype of case
- Need manual button to reset cool life: where to put button? Difficult to access place - maybe aturomatically pressed when module clipped back on, solves water resistance (lifetime of button?)




Ness
Only two tasks:
- Cad model of the actual case, including a see-through compartment and a conductive compartment, ready to be 3D-printed.  (Romeo tells dimensions after assembling circuit)
- Cad model of the door that is receptive to the case being clipped on (make sure it slants inwards etc)
