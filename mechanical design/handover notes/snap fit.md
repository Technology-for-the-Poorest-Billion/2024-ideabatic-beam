Problems with conventional snap-fit mechanisms:
1. Incompatible with 3D printing techniques because of deformation causing large tension in anisotropic 3D printed grain (layer separation is much easier than across layers).
2. Difficult mechanism to remove module after snapping in. Requires the presence of holes in the module, making it not watertight.

### Socket design

Inspired by the original design idea of using the electrical connector between the elecronics module and the temperature sensor module as the main connecting mechanism.

Based on plug socket designs. Pins are arranged such that module orientation is easily determined.
