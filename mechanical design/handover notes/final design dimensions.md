### Initial dimension considerations

BATTERY (tallest component)
battery casing height 15.45 mm
battery holes spacing 15.00 mm
battery holes diameter 3.30 mm

SWITCH (protruding component)
switch body 12.7 mm
switch button 14.51 mm
switch hole max distance 8.63 mm
switch hole min distance 4.50 mm

Consideration: 
Cavity in door top surface must be 15.45 - 12.87 mm = 2.7 mm deep at least.
We want it deep enough for stability of snap-fit mechanism, so choose higher value of 7 mm.

This gives initial internal module casing dimensions of:
Long height = 21.6 mm
Short height = 14.6 mm

Consideration:
Shells should be multiples of 0.8 mm (2 nozzles thick) for 3D printing.
Case cover and case base should form the combined module height.

Therefore:
Case cover of height 3 mm
Case base of (short height) 11.6 mm
