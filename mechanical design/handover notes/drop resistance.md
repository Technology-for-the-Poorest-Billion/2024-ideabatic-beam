## Drop resistance

Two main designs to consider.

### Hemispheres in four corners

Advantages:
1. Symmetrical design.

Limitations:
1. If dropped at a shallower angle, the module is still impacted.
2. The radius of curvature of the lid edge is 14 mm, but module extends above lid by 14.8 mm. Therefore, the hemispheres cannot be exactly at the corners of the lid, or cannot be exact hemispheres. However, the later increases the slenderness of the protruding hemispheres which decreases strength and increases the change of snapping.

### Soft ridge around module

Advantages:
1. Guarantees protection of module.

Limitations:
1. Asymmetrical design may cause further imbalance of force distribution on the torsional spring when opening or closing the door.
2. More material needed than for hemispheres.
3. Very irregular surface that is not very functional or aesthetically pleasing without the presence of the module, a big loss for users that did not opt-in for the module.
4. Takes up more space, may need bigger bag for storage.

Ended up choosing soft ridge due to better protection of module, but further brainstorming is neccessary.
