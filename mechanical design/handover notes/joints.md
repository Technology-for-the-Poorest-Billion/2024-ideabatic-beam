There were problems in interfacing due to 3D printing not producing perfect round surfaces.
Joints were too slender and snap off.

#### Iteration 2

New design direction: 1) square joints. 2) less slender joints.

Much better interfacing. Less slender joints also meant the connecting shear force is less strong, but this can be supplemented with plastic welding to ensure watertight finish in final product.

Module lid component needs to be made out of Aluminium for heat conductivity, so placing the holes in the lid is more compatible with metal manufacture techniques like hole punching.
