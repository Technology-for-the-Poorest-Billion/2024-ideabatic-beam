## Prototyping insights

### 1. CAD design medium

The project was originally planned to be done on OpenSCAD due to the following advantages:
1. Modular programme code
2. Increase accessibility for future design modifications by project groups

However, I faced different limitations:
1. [Most important] Original SMILE design files were on Solidwork, compatibility issues as imported .STL files cannot be modified
2. Not able to directly orient or locate .STL files in OpenSCAD
3. Difficult to assemble components, need to constantly refer back to original Solidworks file
4. Axes are sparse and imprecise, no grid visualisation
5. [Less important] Not as visually intuitive as Solidworks, required time to get used to

As the limitations outweight the advantages, this led me to not pursue OpenSCAD as the final design medium. The designs were done using Solidworks.

### 2. 3D printing
