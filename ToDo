To Do List:
- Location Tracking
- Look into data logging
- Familiarise with last years work and current prototype - a lot of work has been done on the door and cool-life prediction.
- Get hands on the arduino used (and temperature sensor) if available
- 

From Powerpoint:
"Challenge: How to make the self-closing door more robust? Use 2 sensors only to predict
temperature of 18 chambers and remaining cool-life
• consider different solutions for remote settings and lab settings.
• can they be integrated in one chip?
• Optimisation of the self-closing door
• Solution:
Electronics module with display
• Prediction of temperature of 18 chambers (not measured but extracted from an
algorithm using existing experimental data)
• Remaining cool-life prediction: users can decide if they should return to refill icepack or
can continue travelling to the next village?
• Location tracking (what if in remote areas/hilly areas)
• Warning signal: when the door is opened for an x amount of time, when the door is not
closed properly, when the remaining cool life is x hours etc
• Data logging for analysis: e.g. temperature data, when was the door opened and how
has that affected the performance
Self-closing door and area for the clip on- snap fit electronics module
• spring design
• Stress analysis
• Life-time etc"
