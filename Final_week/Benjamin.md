# Deliverables:

- Further feasability assessments, spider rankings on overall designs to justify strategy: single module, focus on improving environmental resistance
- Including update to the axial connection feasibility assessment: incorrect premise originally; need to consider series thermal resistance to all the internal insulation
<br />

- Calulcation proving temperature sensor can be incorrput if certain area of conductive material used for module casing: shows why preferable to external temperature sensor
(include cost assessment of using this much conductive material); with upper limit of heat power produced coming from battery power considerations

- Probably first requires material selection (graphene? silicon?)

<br />

- Drawings of candidate designs for temperature sensor + switch; show the paths for water ingress for the indent desing, and the mode of breakage + cost of raising outside for top-mounting design

- User-oriented button logic to inform button position (accidental pressing? Forgetting to press?)

- Final prototype sketch, incl. cyclinder-hemispheres

- Calculation showing that the loss of thermal resistance due to slight indent on module is negligible.
  
- Overall costing assessment of final design
