# Website
- targeted to general public
- what the overall product is, what you have added to it

- Be explicit about what we are trying to design:

- Be explict about what the previous group did: specifically about what their temperature algorithm does, since we are using this

# Presentation
- Slides + Camera on Zoom recording. Monday evening. 
- All insights into the problem, basically everything you had to consider to get to the final output, but without the excruciating detail

# Github Repository
- Readme acts as Contents page
- Formalise the design problem
- Be explicit about anything that you did but is not presented, or anything you did not consider and why, and future steps
- Use hyperlinks but make a clear progression through the entire repository
