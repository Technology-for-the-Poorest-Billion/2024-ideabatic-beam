# Website
- targeted to general public
- what the overall product is, what you have added to it

# Presentation
- Slides + Camera on Zoom recording. Monday evening. 
- All insights into the problem, basically everything you had to consider to get to the final output, but without the excruciating detail

# Github Repository
- Readme acts as Contents page
- Be explicit about anything that you did but is not presented, or anything you did not consider and why, and future steps
- Use hyperlinks but make a clear progression through the entire repository
