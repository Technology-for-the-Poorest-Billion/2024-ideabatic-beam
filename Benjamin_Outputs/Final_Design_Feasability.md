- Insulation: show that insulation is not significantly compromised
- Modularity: state that it is entirely electronically and mechanically modular
- Robustness: state that, with correct sealing, it is water restistant and with correct protection (cylinder-hemispheres) and clipping mechanism it is mechanically robust
- Temeprature Prediction Veracity: quantify effect of 1ยบ overestimate of external temperature on final cool life prediction
- Cost effectiveness: do a detailed final costing assessment
  (Include cost of rubbery coverings etc. )



  Hence all of the dimensions are satisfied, it is a theoretically successful design. Now build the prototype!
