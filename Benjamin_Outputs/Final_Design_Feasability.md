- Insulation: show that insulation is not significantly compromised




- Modularity: state that it is entirely electronically and mechanically modular



- Robustness: state that, with correct sealing, it is water restistant and with correct protection (cylinder-hemispheres) and clipping mechanism it is mechanically robust



- Temeprature Prediction Veracity: quantify effect of 1º overestimate of external temperature on final cool life prediction



- Cost effectiveness: do a detailed final costing assessment
  (Include cost of rubbery coverings etc. )

  Hence all of the dimensions are satisfied, it is a theoretically successful design. Now build the prototype!

Though not ordered in time, here is an example of a water-resistant cover that would be suitable for covering the switch and button on the module.
