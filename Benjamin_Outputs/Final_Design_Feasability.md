- Insulation: show that insulation is not significantly compromised




- Modularity: state that it is entirely electronically and mechanically modular



- Robustness: state that, with correct sealing, it is water restistant and with correct protection (cylinder-hemispheres) and clipping mechanism it is mechanically robust



- Temeprature Prediction Veracity: quantify effect of 1º overestimate of external temperature on final cool life prediction



- Cost effectiveness: do a detailed final costing assessment
  (Include cost of rubbery coverings etc. )


- electrical costing can be copied across

Material costs:
- 0.9mm thick x 9080mm2 for aluminium sheet (https://www.metals4u.co.uk/materials/aluminium/aluminium-sheet/aluminium-mill-finish-aluminium-sheet/3123-p?ppm=false&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9vqyBhCKARIsAIIcLMEcxx1h4nVGUAGYFfs54U9BD60yTGIhoN8M_dy8MsmMGdnNYN7KQmIaAjlwEALw_wcB
£0.22 for 0.01m2
- 30x14 of 2mm thick acrylic https://www.perspexsheet.uk/clear-000-perspex/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9vqyBhCKARIsAIIcLMEZ89-n_Y2YTYkYBV_6rXlRbnBh4ZYir4bu5BmR-Uv2fd5JJoKAz8saAuZmEALw_wcB
- £0.02 per unit
- 13226.4mm3 of ABS, costs £1.37/kg; density is 1 g/cm3, so we are using 13.2264g, so material cost is £0.02; if we want it pre-processed, £0.31.
- two PVC button covers, £0.24 each

- The logarithmic quantity discount was derived for electrical components, so as a conservative assumption we will here use the single unit cost for materials. (worst case assumptions)

- We will use the upper limit of electrical component quantity discounting (worst-case, conservative assumption)

So only adds £1.03 to material costs, well under budget. 

Manufacutring costs:
- 




  Hence all of the dimensions are satisfied, it is a theoretically successful design. Now build the prototype!

Though not ordered in time, here is an example of a water-resistant cover that would be suitable for covering the switch and button on the module.
