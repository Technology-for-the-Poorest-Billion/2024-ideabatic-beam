## Some additional context:
This project was taken on by a team last year, here is the progress they made and where they fell short:

- successfully made an electronic circuit that displayed the temperature and remaining cool life
- was not very modular, required removal of door which was tedious in practice.
- ambiguous in their final recommendation for position of the temperature sensor
- did not quantify the effect of the electronics module compromising insulation
- mechanical issues with door ergonomics, lack of protection for display screen

<br />

## Formalising the primary design problem:
- electronics module with temperature sensor to inform algorithm and display for user
- module should be clip on clip off (opt in design, easy charging)
- minimise compromise to insulation
- target budget: Â£15 (batch size ~3000)

*Why is there a 'default'? Shouldn't this be an open design problem?*

This is an open design problem, but it has a starting point. 

The starting point reflects the initial preferences of the project partner, which are informed by designs and analysis presented to her by previous contributors to this project. 

Given this, the quality of the communication and justification of our design decisions is crucial.
