The door, as previously designed by other contributors, was sufficiently water-tight - improving water-tightness was not one of our deisgn objectives. 

However, water ingress into the coolbox risks faster warming of the vaccines, due to [water's thermal conductivity being higher than that of air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity_and_resistivity). Additionally, the coolbox filling with water makes the device less accessible to users, and more frequently in need of maintenance. 

Hence it is important that our design does not compromise the existing seal mechanism, which is considered sufficient. 


Additionally, the existing design has a small ridge around the outside, in which the door sits when closed. This is where the door-sensing button will press into. 

The preliminary candidate designs for the placement of the electronics module on the door are as follows: (In each case, only the top layer of the door is drawn - the trapezial structure of the rest of the door extends downwards. The red semicircles represents the button, which sense when the door is closed.)

***Details of Specific Design Candidate 1***

- there a slot indented into the design of the door, which the electronic module clips into
- the open/closed button sensor protrudes out the side of the door

***Details of Specific Design Candidate 2***

- the electronic module clips onto the top surface of the door
- the open/closed button sensor protrudes as low as possible across the top surface of the door, low enough to still be pressed by surrounding ridges when the door is closed

**Assessment of Candidate Designs**

The requirements for a successful design in this area are:
1) Does not compromise water-tightness
2) Mechanically robust (difficult for module to break off; ideal if module is not the first point of contact when coolbox is dropped)
3) Does not significantly compromise insulation
4) Button is low enough that it presses against existing ridges in door design, for door-closed detection

Assessing the two candidates against these criteria:

***Shortcomings of Candidate 1, in which there is a slot for the electronics module to clip into:***

- ****Water-tightness is compromised****.
  The button protrudes out the side of the door rather than across the top face. When the module (including the button) is removed, this will necessarily leave a gap in the water-tight seal, thus allowing for water ingress when the module is charging.

***Shortcomings of Candidate 2, in which the module clips onto the top face:***
- ****Mechanical roubstness****
  The entire module protrudes significantly above the top face of the door, making it the first point of contact for the coolbox if dropped upside down.
  Any impact-absorbing features on the top of the door to mitigate this would need to be large - at least as tall as the electronics module, worsening aesthetics and increasing material costs
- Water tightness is not compromised, as the button slides along the top face, above the existing seal which is left intact. 

<br />

In their best possible arrangements, both of canddiates 1 and 2 comfortably satisfy the insulation and button position criteria (the insulation criteria is examined in more detail later). 

<br />

Following this analysis, a third candidate design is proposed, which is a hybrid of the previous two.

***Details of Specific Design Candidate 3***

- there a shallow slot indented into the design of the door, which the electronic module clips into
- the open/closed button sensor is across the top face of the door, so does not compromise water resistance and is low enough to be pressed when door is closed
  
As it meets all four of the the design requirements, this is design which will be pursued into the physical prototyping stage.
