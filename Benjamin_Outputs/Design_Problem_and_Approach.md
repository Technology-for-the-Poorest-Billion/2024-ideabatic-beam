## Formalising the primary design problem:
- electronics module with temperature sensor to inform algorithm and display for user
- module should be clip on clip off (opt in design, easy charging)
- minimise compromise to insulation
- target budget: Â£15 (batch size ~3000)

<br />

## Some additional context:
This project was taken on by a team last year, here is the progress they made and where they fell short:

- successfully made an electronic circuit that displayed the temperature and remaining cool life
- was not very modular, required removal of door which was tedious in practice.
- ambiguous in their final recommendation for position of the temperature sensor
- did not quantify the effect of the electronics module compromising insulation
- mechanical issues with door ergonomics, lack of protection for display screen

*Why is there a 'default'? Shouldn't this be an open design problem?*

This is an open design problem, but it has a starting point. 

The starting point reflects the initial preferences of the project partner, which are informed by designs and analysis presented to her by previous contributors to this project. 

Given this, the quality of the communication and justification of our design decisions is crucial. 

# Communicating Design Decisions

Part of this project's useful output is a thorough documentation and justification of all design decisions made, quantified and visualised where possible. 

This is useful in the immediate term, as a means of presenting and justifying design decisions to the project partner, and also in the future, as subsequent work on this design problem will be streamlined by the clarity of this discussion, illustrating possibilities that have already been explored and eliminated. 

<br />

To quantify the performace of each design candidate, it will be scored in each of five dimensions:
- Cost effectiveness
- Robustness: Environmental resistance and mechanical robustness
- Insulation
- Veracity of temperature prediction
- User friendliness, primarily concerned with modularity

A candidate's performance can be visualised using a radar plot.

The scores assigned will be 

- somethinng here about the non-linear characteristic curves of threshold dimensions

The scores will then be combined to give a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), which quantifies the overall performance potential of a design. 

Given that a failure to be fit for purpose in any of the five dimensions would render a design unsuitable, the KPI is calculated as the product of the five scores.

$\{KPI}$ = Score 1 $\times$ Score 2 $\times$ Score 3 $\times$ Score 4 $\times$ Score 5

This product-rating method is also useful for eliminating design candidates: evidence that a candidate is unsuitable on any of the five dimensions immediately sets its KPI to zero and eliminates it from the design process. 

As such, each candidate is checked first against its most problematic dimension in a 'feasability test', so that it can be quickly eliminated if unfeasible. 

The radar plot conveniently visualises three important things:
- Area shows which design candidates to proceed with
- Relative strengths and weaknesses of each design candidate
- Areas for maximum improvement on each design candidate


*This document* shows the candidate designs which resulted from brainstorming, feasability assessments and dimension scoring which resulted in the prototyped design being taken forward.
