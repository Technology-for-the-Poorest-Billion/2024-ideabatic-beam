Each analysis checks the design against one of the five dimensions.
Each analysis is either eliminating (attempts to discard a candidate design) or validating (attempts to justify a candidate design being pursued)

- Eliminating analysis: Uses only the most generous assumptions and over-estimates performance (Best-case)
- Validating analysis: Uses only the harshest assumptions and under-estimates performance (Worst-case)

By adhering to the conservative analysis principles, we ensure that:

- No viable designs eliminated 
- No inviable design pursued
