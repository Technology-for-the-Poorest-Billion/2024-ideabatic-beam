- When doing a feasibility assessment, we don’t want to unnecessarily eliminate any candidates, so be as generous as possible to each candidate
- When doing a proof of viability/validation, we don’t want to leave any chance that the final design doesn’t work, so be as harsh as possible to the final design.
