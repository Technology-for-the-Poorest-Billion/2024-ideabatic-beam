# Communicating Design Decisions

Part of this project's useful output is a thorough documentation and justification of all design decisions made, quantified and visualised where possible. 

This is useful in the immediate term, as a means of presenting and justifying design decisions to the project partner, and also in the future, as subsequent work on this design problem will be streamlined by the clarity of this discussion, illustrating possibilities that have already been explored and eliminated. 

<br />

To quantify the performace of each design candidate, it will be scored in each of five dimensions:
- Cost effectiveness
- Robustness: Environmental resistance and mechanical robustness
- Insulation
- Veracity of temperature prediction
- User friendliness, primarily concerned with modularity

A candidate's performance can be visualised using a radar plot.

The scores assigned will be 

- somethinng here about the non-linear characteristic curves of threshold dimensions

The scores will then be combined to give a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), which quantifies the overall performance potential of a design. 

Given that a failure to be fit for purpose in any of the five dimensions would render a design unsuitable, the KPI is calculated as the product of the five scores.

$\{KPI}$ = Score 1 $\times$ Score 2 $\times$ Score 3 $\times$ Score 4 $\times$ Score 5

This product-rating method is also useful for eliminating design candidates: evidence that a candidate is unsuitable on any of the five dimensions immediately sets its KPI to zero and eliminates it from the design process. 

As such, each candidate is checked first against its most problematic dimension in a 'feasability test', so that it can be quickly eliminated if unfeasible. 

The radar plot conveniently visualises three important things:
- Area shows which design candidates to proceed with
- Relative strengths and weaknesses of each design candidate
- Areas for maximum improvement on each design candidate


*This document* shows the candidate designs which resulted from brainstorming, feasability assessments and dimension scoring which resulted in the prototyped design being taken forward.
