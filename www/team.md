## Our Team

Our project involved two main stages: design approach and practical design. The design component was further divided into electronics and mechanical aspects.

The three tasks were then each delegated to a group member based on their strengths and experiences. Benjamin was in charge of the design approach due to his strengths in communication and experience working with temperature prediction algorithms. Romeo was in charge of electronics design due to his experience in electronics prototyping with sensors, displays and Pi 4. Ness was in charge of mechanical design due to her experience with using various CAD software. These assigned roles were a good fit and allowed us to play to our strengths in this project.

The project was also an opportunity to learn new skills. Being in a team of people with diverse experiences also allowed team members to learn from each other. For instance, Ness was able to consulted Romeo on using 3D printers due to him having more experience.

A diverse team also produced conducive discussions where diverse and challenging viewpoints emerged, allowing us to develop better solutions through the sharing of knowledge and ideas. However, this makes the decision making process more time consuming which, under the time pressure, may have led to suppression of dissent that led to subpar decisions being made. Overall, the team worked well together and encouraged each other during difficult times.

## Project Management

Due to the tight time scale and pressure to deliver, our time management was suboptimal. Here are our major pitfalls:

1. We did not settle on a final design until very late in the project. An improvement would be to define the design strategy more clearly, starting from the feasibility study of different designs, such that the design direction of the project is set early on.

2. A lot of time was spent interfacing work between OpenSCAD and Solidworks. A more careful decision about which CAD package to use in design, for example using a list of pros and cons, would also allow for the final design medium to be determined earlier on.

3. We ordered electronics from an overseas supplier, leading to delays in component delivery and having to push back subsequent timeline tasks. Ordering from local suppliers would have been more time and cost effective.

Although these setbacks hindered our progress, we were able to bounce back due to good contingency planning early on:

1. Our project timeline included extra bandwidth in case of external, personal, or technical issues. This allowed more flexibility in our schedule that was necessary.
