#### Modularise the electronics. Minimise the compromise to insulation.

As the electronics module is an additional opt-in product, we must ensure the design must still be watertight and properly insulated without the electronics module. Five key performance indicators (cost effectiveness, robustness, insulation, veracity of temperature prediction and modularity) were used to rank design candidates and determine our project direction.

Rapid prototyping techniques like CAD modelling and 3D printing were used to test various aspects of design, such as joint interfacing. Careful consideration was also taken to choose quality electronics and materials for the final product within our target budget.
