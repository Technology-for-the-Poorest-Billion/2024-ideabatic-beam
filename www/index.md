## Ideabatic's Mission

Current vaccine carriers use cooler boxes that are poorly equipped to handle their transport environment. Vaccines stored in average cooler boxes are shown to last approximately 4 hours in the field, which is simply not enough for last-mile journeys that can last up to 2 days in over 25ÂºC heat. 

Human error is also a problem, as healthcare workers may unknowingly leave cooler boxes open for long periods of time, especially during vaccine administration. Workers may also skimp out on the required number of icepacks, or place the vaccines and icepacks haphazardly. These mistakes significantly reduce the cooling lifetime of the vaccine carrier.

SMILE, or SMart last-miLE Cooling System, aims to combat these issues with a uniquely designed cooler box containing only one single ice pack that can keep 18 vials of vaccines cool for up to 4 days (120 hours), along with a self-closing door mechanism to reduce human error. The design is waterproof, is carefully insulated, and includes straps for comfortable carry as a backpack. Ideabatic also envisions SMILE to be used in other temperature-sensitive applications, as a more efficient and fail-proof alternative to other cooling boxes in the market.

## BEAM's Objectives

Ideabatic had been collaborating with different project groups to develop a temperature display electronics module as an add-on product to the SMILE device. The need for such a product was identified after some users relayed that they wanted to keep track of the temperature in the SMILE device to better ensure the vaccine is stored properly.

Previous project groups have worked on different electronics housing and door slot designs, developing temperature and cool life prediction algorithms and door alert systems, and improving other mechanical features such as the self-closing mechanism and lid ergonomics. BEAM aims to build upon the work done by these previous groups, identifying the limitations of previous designs and improving on these features based on feedback given by SMILE's founder, Kitty Liao, and our own personal insight.

### Our goal: Modularise the electronics. Minimise the compromise to insulation. Improve ergonomics of the door.

### To configure your website:

- The required files to run a basic website are included in the repository. We use here Jekyll to turn markdown files into html that will be automatically updated on the website. The component responsible for this is a GitHub action, which is specified in the folder .github/workflows. There is no need to change this file. However:

- In the settings of your repository, go the section "Pages", and select GitHub Actions in the drop down menu to indicate that this is the way you'd like the webpage to be generated.

- Each time you update the markdown files in the www folder of the repository, it will regenerate the web content. The address of the website will be:

```
https://technology-for-the-poorest-billion.github.io/[your repo name here]
```

- index.md is the root of your website. To link another page from here, located within the www folder, use the following syntax:

```
This is a [link](linkedpage.md) to interesting content.
```

Which results in:

This is a [link](linkedpage.md) to interesting content.

- Pay attention to the header of the markdown files in this section. It contains a title section that you will need to reproduce for each page to render them properly.
