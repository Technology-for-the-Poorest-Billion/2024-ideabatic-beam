# Problem Context

Ideabatic has been collaborating with many different project groups to develop a temperature display electronics module as an add-on product to the SMILE device. The need for such a product was identified after some users relayed that they wanted to keep track of the temperature in the SMILE device to better ensure the vaccine is stored properly.

Previous project groups have worked on different electronics housing and door slot designs, developing temperature and cool life prediction algorithms and door alert systems, and improving other mechanical features such as the self-closing mechanism and lid ergonomics. 

This project aims to build upon the work done by these previous groups, identifying the limitations of previous designs and improving on these features based on feedback given by Kitty Liao (founder of SMILE) and personal insight.

# Teamworking

**Benjamin's role:** The design problem, project management, also working with Romeo on electronics and software implementation

**Romeo's role:**

The electronics and code (already prepared some code in the Raspberry Pi Pico's compatible Python IDE Thonny, 
which should work, just needs to be adapted to the specific temeprature sensor and tested with the circuit once assembled). 

Romeo more suited to how the electronic circuit should actually work, and choosing the appropriate components 
(for example the details of how the switch could be implemented)

**Ness' role:**
Design the electronics module casing and door using OpenSCAD.
3D print designs to assess component compatability and ergonomics.
Transfer drawings of previous and current designs from Solidworks to OpenSCAD to facilitate future development.

**Teamwork:**
- have been meeting multiple times a week to discuss project ideas
- assisting each other in assigned tasks
- constantly discussing project direction and progress on Whatsapp
- also in regular contact with project partner
- expect in-lab hours to increase as electronics components arrive

Personal and technical developments, and work done so far will be presented later by each member.


## Issues encountered:

- actually deciphering all of the available data (not particularly good file management from partner or previous team)
- some design assumptions have been 'locked in' to partner's preferences by previous iterations of the project. Careful communication of deviations required. 
- Surprisingly long lead time on component orders (first order of components still haven't arrived, second order made today)

## Steps already taken, and future steps to overcome issues:

- During lead wait time, conceptual aspects of the project such as feasability assessments and CAD translation have been carried out
- Explicit communications with project partner about the intentions to revise design assumptions
- Making direct contact with contributors to previous projects to understand rationales and recommendations
- A revision of the objectives to ensure we can deliver useful output in the timeframe

• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
