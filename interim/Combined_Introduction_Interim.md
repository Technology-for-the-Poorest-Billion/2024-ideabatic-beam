# Problem Context

Ideabatic has been collaborating with many different project groups to develop a temperature display electronics module as an add-on product to the SMILE device. The need for such a product was identified after some users relayed that they wanted to keep track of the temperature in the SMILE device to better ensure the vaccine is stored properly.

Previous project groups have worked on different electronics housing and door slot designs, developing temperature and cool life prediction algorithms and door alert systems, and improving other mechanical features such as the self-closing mechanism and lid ergonomics. This project aims to build upon the work done by these previous groups, identifying the limitations of previous designs and improving on these features based on feedback given by Kitty Liao (founder of SMILE) and personal insight.

# Teamworking

Benjamin's role: The design problem, project management

Romeo's role:

The electronics and code (already prepared some code in the Raspberry Pi Pico's compatible Python IDE Thonny, 
which should work, just needs to be adapted to the specific temeprature sensor and tested with the circuit once assembled). 

Romeo more suited to how the electronic circuit should actually work, and choosing the appropriate components 
(for example the details of how the switch could be implemented)

Ness' role:
Design the electronics module casing and door using OpenSCAD.
3D print designs to assess component compatability and ergonomics.
Transfer drawings of previous and current designs from Solidworks to OpenSCAD to facilitate future development.

Teamwork:


Personal and technical developments will be presented later by each member.

# Summary of work done


## Issues encountered:

- actually deciphering all of the available data (not particularly good file management from partner or previous team)
- surprisingly long lead time on component orders (need to order all components we will need today if not before this presentation)

## Steps taken to overcome issues:



• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
• Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt and how have you learned it?);
