# How do we know if the door is closed/open

- external contacts that meet at a plate to tell us if it's open
issues with corrosion/lifetime
potential issues with fatigue

- comparing the difference in temperature between the two temperature sensors
issues with 
can also compare the internal with the predicted

- do we actually need the internal sensor
algorithm simply uses the external sensor
need to contact last years team

- button switch


- potentially measure angle of door? very complicated


- ultrasonic/infrared distance sensors?

- something using the hinge as electrical contacts???



# How will we connect the internal sensor to the external module?


// # PROTOTYPE/DESIGN FOR WIRELESS CONNNECTION
