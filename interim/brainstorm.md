# How do we know if the door is closed/open

- external contacts that meet at a plate to tell us if it's open
issues with corrosion/lifetime
potential issues with fatigue


- comparing the difference in temperature between the two temperature sensors
issues with 
can also compare the internal with the predicted


- do we actually need the internal sensor
algorithm simply uses the external sensor
need to contact last years team


- for connection to internal sensor:
  wires going straight through down the door
  wiring around -- issues with wear
  going through metal hinges/through door switch contact



- button switch


- potentially measure angle of door? very complicated


- ultrasonic/infrared distance sensors?

- something using the hinge as electrical contacts???

- internal sensor preferred for mounting stability, reduces influence of electronics heating corrputing, better accuracy (fewer components whose thermal resistances need to be estimated)

# How will we connect the internal sensor to the external module?
