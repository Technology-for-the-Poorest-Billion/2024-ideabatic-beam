My role: Project management, The design problem

Some additional context:
This project was taken on by a team last year, here is the progress they made and where they fell short:


Redefining the objective:

Following discussions with our project partner and Alexandre, the objectives for the project have been simplified:

Primary goal: Make the electronics modular, minimising the compromise to insulation.

Formalising the design problem:



Constraints on the design:






If the primary goal is comfortably satisfied within the time constraints of the project, we have some bonus secondary objectives which can be addressed:
- implementing GPS tracking and data logging on the electronics module
- adapting the temperature prediction algorithm to account for the door open vs door closed



Romeo's role:

The electronics and code (I have already prepared some code in the Raspberry Pi Pico's compatible Python IDE Thonny, 
which should work, just needs to be adapted to the specific temeprature sensor and tested with the circuit once assembled. 

Romeo more suited to how the electronic circuit should actually work, and choosing the appropriate components 
(for example the details of how the switch could be implemented)

Teamwork:



Work done:


Issues encountered:

- actually deciphering all of the available data

Steps taken to overcome issues:


Prototype candidate designs:

- draw each one, technical feasibility assessment of each one.

- a brief calculation showing the insulation lost to a small cylindrical hole for wire through the insulating cuboid 
(in terms of depth of cuboid etc)

Radar plot for 


Introducing the Key Performance Indicator: Area of the Radar Plot.

Dimensions of Radar plot:
- cost
- mechanical robustness
- electronic 
- insulation efficacy

Ideal output will be a visual and quantified representation of the experienced or expected suitability of each candidate design.

Experiences for the ones that we actually make into prototypes, 


Each student would ideally present a specific aspect they have contributed to (giving credits to other where appropriate) and briefly explain how the work package they present fits within the overall project

• Team working skills, good log of work done and issues
• Troubleshooting skills and the ability to reassess objectives when necessary.
• Technical characterisation of how well the prototype meets the project objective


• Where applicable, show an early prototype and demonstrate feasibility;
• Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt and how have you learned it?);
• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
