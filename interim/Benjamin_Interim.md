My role: Project management, The design problem

Some additional context:
This project was taken on by a team last year, here is the progress they made and where they fell short:

- they made an electronic circuit but it was not modular, was not able to clip on and off from the door


• Troubleshooting skills 


Reassessing and redefining the objective:

Following discussions with our project partner and Alexandre, the objectives for the project have been simplified:

Primary goal: Make the electronics modular, minimising the compromise to insulation.

Formalising the design problem:



Constraints on the design:




If the primary goal is comfortably satisfied within the time constraints of the project, we have some bonus secondary objectives which can be addressed:
- implementing GPS tracking and data logging on the electronics module
- adapting the temperature prediction algorithm to account for the door open vs door closed

- Kitty, our project partner, still very interested in using the temperature sensor on the door. Part of the useful output of this project will be a demonstration of why this is not necessary, by attempting to quantify with a KPI the drawbacks. 

Prototype candidate designs:

Radar plot for 


Introducing the Key Performance Indicator: Area of the Radar Plot. Alternatively just a weighted product of the various dimensions. Probably more appropriate since each one is essential, so any one going to zero should give a KPI of zero. 

Dimensions of Radar plot:
- cost
- mechanical robustness
- insulation efficacy
- accuracy and verasity of temperature measurement

Ideal output will be a visual and quantified representation of the experienced or expected suitability of each candidate design.

Experiences for the ones that we actually make into prototypes, 


Each student would ideally present a specific aspect they have contributed to (giving credits to other where appropriate) and briefly explain how the work package they present fits within the overall project

• Team working skills, good log of work done and issues



My output for tomorrow:
- A schematic of the electrical circuit we are looking to design. Three variants - external sensor, internal sensor wired, internal sensor wireless
- An illustration of the added uncertainty caused by putting the temperature sensor external (thermal resistive component)
- Drawing of each overall design considered so far
- Outline of the dimensions of the key performance indicator, some radar plots for each candidate design (to be updated)
- A rough rating of each candidate's rankings on radar plot
(eg a brief calculation showing the insulation lost to a small cylindrical hole for wire through the insulating cuboid 
(in terms of depth of cuboid etc))




• Where applicable, show an early prototype and demonstrate feasibility;
• Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt and how have you learned it?);
• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
