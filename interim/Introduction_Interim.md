Benjamin's role: Project management, The design problem

Romeo's role:

The electronics and code (already prepared some code in the Raspberry Pi Pico's compatible Python IDE Thonny, 
which should work, just needs to be adapted to the specific temeprature sensor and tested with the circuit once assembled). 

Romeo more suited to how the electronic circuit should actually work, and choosing the appropriate components 
(for example the details of how the switch could be implemented)

Teamwork:



Work done:


Issues encountered:

- actually deciphering all of the available data (not particularly good file management from partner or previous team)
- surprisingly long lead time on component orders (need to order all components we will need today if not before this presentation)

Steps taken to overcome issues:



• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
• Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what have you learnt and how have you learned it?);
