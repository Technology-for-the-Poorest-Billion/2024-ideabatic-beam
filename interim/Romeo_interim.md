# Romeo's role:
Predominantly focussed on the physical aspect of the electronics module, along with dealing with the implementation of the software.

## Tasks completed (?)
- Sent order for the electronic components required; ETA Tuesday 28/05.
- Brainstormed different ideas with Benjamin to narrow down different designs to detect the door being open/closed that least compromises the insulation.
  - Button switch that is pressed when the door is closed, as the last years team. (CAN INCLUDE PICTURE?)
  - An open circuit that is shut when the door closes, likely done through two open contacts that conduct via a plate when the door is shut (CAN INCLUDE PICTURE?)
  - 


## Main tasks remaining:
- Combine the electronics into an "electronics module", working with Ness to build a case via 3D printing. 

- Designing a way to interface the electronics module with the internal temperature sensor. Current method is to use a pair of male/female headers to connect the module to the internal temperature sensor, with the following routing ideas:
  - Wire that leads from the module connector to the temperature sensor, see Benjamin's work.
  - Route wiring through the surface of the door, using the hinge as an electrical connection.
- Trialling methods of detecting the door state.
- Reconciling the code the team last year had with our prototype
  - Converting the code to python for better function with Pico.
- 



Notes to tackle:
<br> Water resistance: Electronics module prototype likely won't be water resistant, which could be especially different noting that the module would involve a screen, buttons, a USB port for charging, and potentially a micro SD card slot, though for this we consider having this only accessible inside the casing. 
<br> This is a conceptual prototype, and the external case is highly water resistant.
