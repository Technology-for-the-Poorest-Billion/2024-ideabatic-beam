## Tasks completed
- Learned basic skills in OpenSCAD and exporting .STL files.
- Preliminary design of electronics module casing on OpenSCAD ready for future compatibility adjustments.
- Preparing for 3D printing of casing.
- Transfer of SMILE design files into OpenSCAD (shell and door).

## Personal and technical developments

Feeling burntout after exams and being overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task presented:
- Reevaluation of what could be done, what could be modified (door design using Solidworks instead)

Understanding OpenSCAD syntax:
- Simple but required time to get used to and not as intuitive as Solidworks.
- Using difference/intersection commands to edit .STL imported files becomes rather buggy.
